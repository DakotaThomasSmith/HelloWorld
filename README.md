# HelloWorld
This project was created to gain hands on experience with Git/Github

So, I can just start adding all sorts of stuff here and then commit the changes, create a pull requeste, and then merge this back into main. 

This is going to be my second commit and I am going to create a pull request first before merging it back into main.
